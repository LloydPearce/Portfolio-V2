          Visual Novel
        </div>

        <div class = "exp1-text">
          One of my first projects utilizing HTML/CSS and Javascript was making a visual novel. I based the visual novel around my favorite novel series called Oregairu. The project composed of numerous invisible buttons, images, and text boxes and displaying the right elements upon clicking the corresponding buttons. The project was difficult in the sense that creating every scene was very repetitive and time consuming.
          <br><br>
          In addition, I learned how to implement background music. I had to change the volume and edit it using Javascript as the original background music was too loud. I also learned how to inject some online elements and manipulate them, the main example being the slider button that toggles the background music. Lastly, getting the introductory video at the start of the visual novel was another challenge as I had to play around with the positioning and understand how videos work in HTML.

          Steam VR
        </div>

        <div class = "exp2-text">
          At my highschool, I had the oppurtunity to experiment and play around with a HTC Vive. With the HTC Vive, I immediately tried to program a game utilizing the free Steam VR framework. Learning how to use the Steam VR to code game mechanics was incredibly difficult. As of now, there is a lack of tutorials and proper explanations regarding important functions in Steam VR. Even with these difficulties, I still tried my best to code a game and managed to create a bare-bones game that allows the player to shoot balloons with a gun.

          HW Helper
        </div>

        <div class = "exp3-text">
          Another small HTML/CSS project that I made is a task organizer called the Homework Helper. This project was more focused on developing a proper framework with Javascript. The project allows the user to add their own tasks to a list and search through the full list of tasks.
          <br><br>
          Initially, I tried to make the project utilizing Firebase with a Javascript back end. This way I would be able to store the user's data on the cloud and the user would be able to refresh the page without completely losing his / her tasks. Unfortunately, due to the limitations of Firebase, I was unable to fully implement Firebase into the project. In the end, I had to rely only using Javascript which made the project only being able to store the user's data locally.

          Discord Bot
        </div>

        <div class = "exp4-text">
          One of my better projects is a Discord bot that I coded using only Java. This Discord bot served as the main framework of a Discord server. The Discord server is aimed at helping students find helpers to help with their homework.
          <br><br>
          The bot is in charge of organizing the roles of helpers and other users. There is also a reputation system and a report system that can notify moderators and admins of individuals that were reported. Lastly, the bot actively censors profanity that is typed by any users.
