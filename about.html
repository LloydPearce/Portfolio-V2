          Who Am I?
        </div>
        I'm Kyle Hu. I am a senior at a highschool in Taiwan and plan to attend University in California. After university, I plan to work as a programmer. In my spare time I play games, watch anime, and read novels.
        <br><br>
        I was born in the United States but have lived in Taiwan from 7th grade to 12 grade. Ever since moving to Taiwan, I discovered my interest in Computer Science. I have some experience in game development and web development throughout my four years in highschool.
