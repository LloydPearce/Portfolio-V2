          What are my capabilities?

        Recently, I have been steadily practicing my front end skills in HTML and CSS. In addition, I am capable of integrating Javascript into websites as well. I am not very familiar with coding the backend aspect of websites.
        <br><br>
        I am quite proficient in Java as I took AP Computer Science A previously. I have coded some projects in Java as well.
        <br><br>
        Recently I have been learning how to use Unity and code in C#, but I am still a beginner. I have had some experience in coding with Python but I am not as proficient in Python compared to Java and Javascript.
